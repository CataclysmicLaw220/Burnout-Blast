# Burnout Escape

## Princeton Hackathon

**Burnout Escape** is a 2D side-scrolling endless runner where players control Booker, an office worker overwhelmed by stress. One day, he finally snaps and flees his workplace. However, his manifested responsibilities—nightmarish versions of work-related burdens—chase him as he runs. 

## Game Concept & Story

Each level introduces new manifestations of burnout, such as:

- **Emails (Swarms of Floating Paper):** Block Booker's path, forcing him to dodge or weave through.
- **Deadlines (Treadmill Floors):** Sections where he must run faster or risk getting sucked into a void of exhaustion.
- **Micromanaging Boss (Giant Floating Head):** Occasionally appears to summon obstacles or slow him down.
- **Bills (Heavy Chains):** Temporarily weigh him down, reducing speed and jump height.

Booker must run, jump, slide, and break free from these burdens while managing exhaustion. If he slows down too much, he succumbs to burnout and must restart.

## Game Mechanics & Features

- **Endless Runner Mechanics:** Fast-paced gameplay requiring constant movement.
- **Burnout Meter (Stamina System):**
  - Running, jumping, and dodging deplete stamina.
  - Recharge stamina using energy drinks or coffee.
  - When stamina reaches zero, Booker stumbles, falls, and "burns out."
- **Symbolic UI Design:** A burnout meter replaces a traditional health bar.
- **Mental Health Mini-Games:** Optional distractions that provide larger stamina boosts.

## Levels

The game consists of three levels:

1. **Office Escape** – Evading work-related stress.
2. **City Streets** – Facing societal expectations and financial stress.
3. **Subway / Mental Collapse** – A surreal descent into total burnout, requiring the player to break free mentally.
