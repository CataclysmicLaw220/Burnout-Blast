# Burnout-Blast
Princeton Hackathon

Game Concept & Story
Your game, "Burnout Escape", is a 2D side-scrolling runner where players control Booker, an office worker overwhelmed by stress, who finally snaps and flees his workplace. However, as he runs, his manifested responsibilities—nightmarish versions of work-related burdens—chase him.
Each level introduces new manifestations of burnout, like:
Emails (Swarms of Floating Paper) – Blocking his path, forcing him to dodge or weave through.


Deadlines (Treadmill Floors) – Sections where he must run faster or risk getting sucked into a void of exhaustion.


Micromanaging Boss (Giant, Floating Head) – Occasionally appearing to summon obstacles or slow him down.


Bills (Heavy Chains) – Temporarily weighing him down, reducing speed and jump height.


Booker must run, jump, slide, and break free from these burdens, with exhaustion creeping up over time. If he slows down too much, he’s consumed by burnout and must restart.
